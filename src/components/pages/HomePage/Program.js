            <p>Foundations is an intensive part-time course designed to help you master the core concepts of JavaScript before you get to campus. In Foundations, you'll be working on a targeted core curriculum with live instructors and real coding projects. You'll be prepared to hit the ground running when you come to campus.</p>

            <p>While the required on-campus Fullstack course runs from 9:30am to 6:30pm — many students stay much longer to attend talks and to work on projects. You'll truly be in an immersive environment - like moving to Beijing to learn Chinese. Much of your learning will happen through hands-on workshops and building projects. And our Masters Series will take you beyond software and mold you into a well-rounded engineer.
