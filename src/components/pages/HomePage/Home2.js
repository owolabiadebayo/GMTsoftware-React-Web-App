<p >Being a great software engineer means not only being fluent with the latest frameworks and programming languages, but also having an evolved intuition for writing code that is efficient, secure and maintainable. The Fullstack curriculum is designed to help you build a strong theoretical core as well as master higher level technologies in software development for the web.</p>
<p >The stack we teach is fullstack JavaScript. JavaScript is here in a big way and it is growing bigger every day. This surge in popularity is driven by the demands of today's internet users for real-time, interactive and dynamic applications, built in JavaScript. </p>
